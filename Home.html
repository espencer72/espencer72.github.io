             <h2><em>Why am I taking this class?</em></h2>

              <p>I have three options for my future and what career I want to choose. I'm very good at writing but I am also very interested in culinary arts, and psychology. Each one of these things could have needs for computer knowledge. Writing more so, as I would most likely be on a computer often. But also because journalism also includes websites, for news, blogs, sharing research and much more. Culinary schooling is less likely. If I were to become a therapist/counselor of any sort, I would need to get my information out there with a website. I would also need to keep track of my patients. In order to do that I would need to keep spreadsheets and if I wanted I could make my own way of keeping track of them. Computer science is also something <strong>cool and useful</strong> to know. In the long run having this new knowledge wonâ€™t hinder me and it will definitely help in my college applications.</p>
     <h2><em>What I'm hoping to learn by the end of this class:</em></h2>

             <p>I am hoping to learn how to be safer online and how to make my <strong>own</strong> recources. It is very impotant to me to have recources with my career choices.</p>
