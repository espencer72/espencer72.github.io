                 I have three options for my future and what career I want to choose. I'm very good at writing but I am also very interested in culinary arts, and psychology. Each one of these things could have needs for computer knowledge. Writing more so, as I would most likely be on a computer often. But also because journalism also includes websites, for news, blogs, sharing research and much more. Culinary schooling is less likely. If I were to become a therapist/counselor of any sort, I would need to get my information out there with a website. I would also need to keep track of my patients. In order to do that I would need to keep spreadsheets and if I wanted I could make my own way of keeping track of them. Computer science is also something cool and useful to know. In the long run having this new knowledge wonâ€™t hinder me and it will definitely help in my college applications.
